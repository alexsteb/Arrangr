TODO small:
GUI:
-After Guitar Settings, don't allow selection of arpeggio and STT anymore
-Checkboxes at selected tracks should be set if already once imported
-Selection what instruments plays the melody (only this then + changing the octaves)
-Choosing melody track doesn't work
-After changing Guitar settings, instrument becomes piano..

Import:
-gameofthrones orchestra -> Apparently the very first track has information

GuitarPro-Export:
-Tuning umdrehen (besonders Ukulele)

-Create trioles out of 16-16-(16)-16
-Fill up tones, if there is only a 16th or 8th pause
-Difficulty level -> Removing certain tones that are difficult to reach / removing fret changes if they can be easily replaced?
-Red measures and weird rhythm with Hook - Flight To Neve.mid
-Option to create chords
-Twice export has error
-Hook l√§dt jetzt gar nicht

midi_split:
-Apply tone lists for timpani etc. (filter)
-chord_track function does not consider multiple tones per instrument
